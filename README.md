Hello everyone :)

I'd like to introduce to You how to program ATtiny13A microprocessor.
I will work with Datasheet using microprocessor registers.
All examples in this repository will be written using embedded C language.

I'll focus on how-to-set ATtiny13A features like

EEPROM

If You want to get to know how to program the rest of features see ATmega328p repository.
